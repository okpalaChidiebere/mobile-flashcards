The easiest way to generate both the .apk and the .ipa files is to use Expo's exp CLI. First, run ```console npm install -g exp``` Once that's installed (and after you've configured your app.json file), you can run ```console exp build:ios``` to build your .ipa file, and ```console exp build:android``` to build your .apk file.

Note that these will take anywhere from 10-20 minutes to build, so you'll need to be patient. To check the status of the build you can run exp build:status. Eventually that command will give you a URL where you can go to download either your .ipa or .apk files.
